This is one of the extensions that I use on a daily basis to help identify who introduced a bug, or who's been writing sloppy code. It also makes it so simple and super fast to track down how long a bug has been present by allowing you to see who touched the line last, right in your editor. There are also a number of other features that make this extension a must have and an absolute time saver.

#### Better Comments

Name: Better Comments
Id: aaron-bond.better-comments
Description: Improve your code commenting by annotating with alert, informational, TODOs, and more!
Version: 3.0.2
Publisher: Aaron Bond
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments

This extension makes commenting more detailed by allowing you to draw attention to important parts of comments or docs strings. If you need more than it has to offer, then you can add custom highlighting in the extension settings.

#### Auto Rename Tag

Name: Auto Rename Tag
Id: formulahendry.auto-rename-tag
Description: Auto rename paired HTML/XML tag
Version: 0.1.10
Publisher: Jun Han
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag

This Extension is great for when you need to make edits to HTML tags. It's both a time saver, and can serve as a validator for making sure the right tags are actually linked.

#### Error Lens

Name: Error Lens
Id: usernamehw.errorlens
Description: Improve highlighting of errors, warnings and other language diagnostics.
Version: 3.15.0
Publisher: Alexander
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens

This is another of those extensions that I couldn't function without. It has helped me to remove so many bugs from my code, before even trying to run it. This is highly recommended that you make this part of your global extensions.

#### Trailing Spaces

Name: Trailing Spaces
Id: shardulm94.trailing-spaces
Description: Highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash!
Version: 0.4.1
Publisher: Shardul Mahadik
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces

If you're anything like me, then you'll undoubtedly loath the thought of unnecessary spaces trailing undetected all over your well formatted and well kept code base, well this extension shines a nice red spotlight on them for you to see. Even if ypu're not like me, you can still stand to benefit from this extension as it can help serve as a bit of a cyber security defense in the form of preventing trailing space attacks whereby trailing spaces can be injected into a file and then read by another malicious program which can then execute the payload create by reading the trailing spaces. The nice thing about this extension is that you cna configure a shortcut that will remove all trailing spaces from every line in the file you're currently in.

#### Duplicate selection or line

Name: Duplicate selection or line
Id: geeebe.duplicate
Description: Duplicate functionality like you are used to
Version: 1.0.2
Publisher: Greg Bacchus
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geeebe.duplicate

This extension is really handy for being able to quickly copy a line or lines of code and create a duplicate right below. This is helpful for when you either need to have multiple lines of code with only slight variations, such as performing multiple database queries with using different variable names, or if you have an entire block of code that needs to be tun multiple times but has slight variations within each one. This will definitely be a helpful tool to have up your sleeve.
